# loss

Find below the existing configs for the loss folder. To have your YAML file indexed, add a docstring at the beginning of the file.
The docstring should be a series of comment lines starting with two '#' characters.

Example:
```
## This is a docstring
## describing the YAML file.
key: value
```


## in_batch_contrastive_loss.yaml

Computes the in-batch contrastive loss.
